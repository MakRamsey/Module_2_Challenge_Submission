# Module_2_Challenge_Submission

Greetings! Please see the included files (Sheet 1, Sheet 2 & Sheet 3 Excel screenshots as well as a .vbs file containing the VBA code) for the Module 2 Challenge submission. In this challenge we utilized a dataset that contained daily stock ticker information and created a VBA script for associated analysis output (Unique Ticker Names, Yearly Change, Percent Change, Total Stock Volume, Greatest % Increase, Greatest % Decrease and Greatest Total Volume).

Thank you!
